      "url": "https://github.com/whati001/keksbox",
      "summary": "Overview\r\n\r\nThe Keksbox is a homegrown music box that allows streaming of audio files/audiobooks to an external speaker. The usability is child-friendly, as it utilizes \"keks\" tags instead of traditional CDs or otherwise. Streaming to a loudspeaker instead of a headset lets us share fun and experience the audiobooks together. The box differentiates between a standard and custom audio set. The standard set should be \"burned\" to the device during setup, whereby the custom set can be adjusted at any time via a web-based portal. This allows parents to assign each \"keks\" a default audio file, and the children can overwrite it with their audio files.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to demonstrate that everybody with a basic background can develop nice products. Studying a programming language or software architecture for years is unnecessary. Instead, managing to empower Linux is sufficient to build starving products.",
